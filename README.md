A formalization of the Dedekind real numbers in Coq.

## Structure of the modules:

* `MiscLemmas`: various lemmas about rational number
* `Cut`: definition of Dedekind cuts and several other basic notions
* `Additive`: Additive structure of the reals
* `Multiplication` : Multiplicative structure of the relas
* `Order` : The order on the reals
* `Archimedean`: the proof that the reals satisfy the archimedean property
* `Completeness`: the reals are Dedekind-complete
