## Structure of the modules:

* `Cut`: definition of Dedekind cuts and several other basic notions
* `MiscLemmas`: various lemmas about rational number
* `Arithmetic`: definitions and properties of arithmetical operations
* `Lipschitz`: definitions and facts about locally Lipschitz functions
* `Archimedean`: the proof that the reals satisfy the archimedean property
